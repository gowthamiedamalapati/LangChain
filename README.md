# 🧠 AI Code Review Assistant

**LLM-powered code analysis with RAG (OpenAI + Pinecone)**

This project is a full-stack AI Code Review Assistant that analyzes code, detects bugs/security issues, and suggests improvements. It also supports **auto-fixing** small issues using LLM reasoning.

🔍 Built to learn & explore **AI integration engineering**, including:

* **LLM prompt orchestration**
* **RAG using Pinecone**
* **Embeddings for similarity search**
* **Full-stack integration (React + Express)**

---

## 🚀 Features

* Code review with structure & explanations
* Auto-fix suggestions
* Security & performance issue detection
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Pinecone
* Clean UI for uploading/pasting code

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

* React
* TailwindCSS

### **Backend**

* Node.js + Express
* Zod for validation
* OpenAI API
* Pinecone (vector DB)

## 📦 Project Structure

```
/backend
  - server.js
  - pine.js
  - prompt.md
  - embeddings.js
/frontend
  - src/
  - public/
```

---

## 🔧 Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Add your API keys in `.env` (backend):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_key
PINECONE_INDEX=your_index
```

## ▶️ Running the App

```bash
# backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 📌 Learnings

This project helped me explore:
✔ How LLMs behave with and without RAG
✔ Context injection using embeddings
✔ Full-stack AI workflow
✔ Debugging LLM pipelines end-to-end
